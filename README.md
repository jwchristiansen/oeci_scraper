# oeci_scraper

`oeci_scraper` scrapes case information from the Oregon eCourt Case Information (OECI) system.

## Tutorial

To get started, you can check out [my walk-through](https://joelc.io/build-court-records-scraper).

## Disclaimer

This code is __only__ meant to demonstrate a rough sketch of how one might use a computer to gather case file information. It is easy to imagine how one might alter it to expand temporal scope, run at set times, work in various frameworks, etc.
